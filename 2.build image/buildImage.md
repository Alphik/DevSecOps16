# ```dockerfile Instructions and Examples

This document provides an overview of ```dockerfile instructions, using the Ubuntu base image for each example.

1. `FROM`

The `FROM` instruction sets the base image for the Docker container. It is always the first instruction in a ```dockerfile.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
```

This example pulls the latest Ubuntu image from Docker Hub.

Command to Build and Run:

```bash
docker build -t app:1.0 .
```

to run the image:

```bash
docker run -it app:1.0
```

2. `COPY`
   The COPY instruction copies files or directories from the host machine to the container.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
COPY ./myfile.txt /app/myfile.txt
```

This copies myfile.txt from the current directory on the host to the /app/ directory in the container.

Command to Build and Run:

```bash


docker build -t copyexample:1.0 .
```

run it at:

```bash
docker run -it copyexample:1.0
```

3. ADD
   The ADD instruction works similarly to COPY but can also extract compressed files and fetch files from URLs.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
ADD ./archive.tar.gz /app/
```

This extracts archive.tar.gz into the /app/ directory in the container.

Command to Build and Run:

```bash
docker build -t addexample:1.0 .
```

Run the container

```bash
docker run -it addexample:1.0
```

4. RUN
   The RUN instruction executes commands inside the container during the build process.

```dockerfile


FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
```

This updates the package list and installs curl.

Command to Build and Run:

```bash
docker build -t runexample:1.0 .
```

Run the container

```bash
docker run -it runexample:1.0
```

5. ENV
   The ENV instruction sets environment variables inside the container.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
ENV MY_ENV_VAR=myvalue
```

This sets the environment variable MY_ENV_VAR to myvalue.

Command to Build and Run:

```bash
docker build -t envexample:1.0 .
```

Run the container

```bash
docker run -it  envexample:1.0
```

6. ARG
   The ARG instruction defines build-time variables that can be passed at build time.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
ARG VERSION=1.0
RUN echo "Building version $VERSION"
```

You can pass a different value for VERSION at build time:

```bash

docker build --build-arg VERSION=2.0 -t argexample:1.0 .
```

7. EXPOSE
   The EXPOSE instruction informs Docker that the container will listen on the specified network ports at runtime.

```dockerfile

FROM ubuntu:latest
EXPOSE 8080
```

This example exposes port 8080.

Command to Build and Run:

```bash
docker build -t exposeexample:1.0 .
```

Run the container

```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 exposeexample:1.0
```

8. CMD
   The CMD instruction provides the default command to run when a container is started.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
CMD ["echo", "Hello, World!"]
```

This will print "Hello, World!" when the container is run.

Command to Build and Run:

```bash
docker build -t cmdexample:1.0 .
```

Run the container

```bash
docker run cmdexample:1.0
```

9. ENTRYPOINT
   The ENTRYPOINT instruction configures a container to run as an executable.

````dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
CMD ["Hello from ENTRYPOINT"]
This makes the container always run echo. The default argument ("Hello from ENTRYPOINT") can be overridden.

Command to Build and Run:
```bash
docker build -t entrypointexample:1.0 .
````

Run the container

```bash

docker run entrypointexample:1.0
```

Override CMD argument

```bash
docker run entrypointexample:1.0 "Overridden!"
```

10. WORKDIR
    The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for any subsequent RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest
WORKDIR /app
RUN touch myfile.txt
```

This sets /app as the working directory and creates myfile.txt in that directory.

Command to Build and Run:

```bash
docker build -t workdirexample:1.0 .
```

# Run the container

docker run -it workdirexample:1.0
.dockerignore
The .dockerignore file helps reduce the size of the Docker context by excluding files or directories that shouldnâ€™t be copied to the image.

Example .dockerignore file:

```bash
node_modules
.git
*.log
```

This prevents the node_modules directory, .git folder, and any .log files from being included in the Docker build context.

Building Docker Images with Tags and Versions
To build a Docker image with a specific tag and version, use the -t flag:

```bash

docker build -t <image_name>:<version> .
```

Example:

```bash
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
```

Running Docker Containers
To run a Docker container from an image, use the docker run command:

```bash

docker run -it <image_name>:<version>
```

Example:

```bash
docker run -it myapp:1.0
```
