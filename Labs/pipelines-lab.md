# Jenkins Pipeline Labs

## Lab 1: Environment Setup and Custom Environments

**Objective:** Learn how to define and use environments in Jenkins pipelines.

### Tasks:

- Set up global environment variables using Jenkins pipeline syntax.
- Create dynamic environment variables using Groovy scripting.
- Use custom environment scopes for specific build stages.

---

## Lab 2: Docker Agents

**Objective:** Use Docker as Jenkins build agents to standardize the build environment.

### Tasks:

- Configure Docker plugin in Jenkins.
- Create a pipeline that uses a specific Docker image as the agent.
- Run build and test commands inside the Docker container.

---

## Lab 3: Full CI/CD Pipeline

**Objective:** Build a complete CI/CD pipeline for a sample application.

### Tasks:

- Clone a repository from GitHub as the source code.
- Build the application and run tests.
- Generate test reports and deploy the application to a staging server.

---

## Lab 4: AWS CLI Integration

**Objective:** Use AWS CLI commands within a Jenkins pipeline.

### Tasks:

- Configure AWS credentials in Jenkins using environment variables or the credentials plugin.
- Use AWS CLI to list S3 buckets in an account.
- Deploy files to an S3 bucket from the pipeline.

---

## Lab 5: All Together

**Objective:** Create a comprehensive pipeline combining all the above concepts.

### Tasks:

- Clone a repository and use a Docker agent for building the application.
- Set up environment variables for staging/production.
- Test the application and deploy it to AWS (e.g., upload artifacts to S3 or update an AWS Lambda function).
